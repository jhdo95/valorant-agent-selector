# Valorant Agent Selector - MERN Stack Application

- The Valorant Agent Selector is a full-stack single-page application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. It allows users to log in or sign up to take a quiz, and based on their quiz responses, the application recommends a Valorant agent to the user.

The application is a fusion of coding proficiency and a genuine interest in enhancing the player experience by providing personalized agent recommendations based on individual playstyles. Through the MERN stack, the Valorant Agent Selector aims to seamlessly connect my coding expertise with the thrill of gaming.
